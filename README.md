- Detailed answers and concise summaries for each topic
- JSON output for easy integration

## Key Capabilities

- Document hierarchy enforcement based on authority ranking

## Configuration

Key settings in `main.py`:

```python
HOA_DOCS_DIR = "./input/hoa_documents"  # Input documents location
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4o-mini"              # AI model selection
TEMPERATURE = 0.1                       # Response determinism (lower = more focused)
OUTPUT_DIR = "./output"                 # Results location
```

## Usage

1. Place HOA documents in the **_input/hoa_documents_** directory
2. Run the analysis:

```

python main.py

```

3. Find results in the output directory:

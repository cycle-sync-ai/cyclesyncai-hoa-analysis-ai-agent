"""
Comprehensive script to:
1. Create/Update an AI assistant with File Search enabled.
2. Upload and process documents (Word, PDF, TXT, MD) into a vector store.
3. Answer 20 questions iteratively, prioritizing information based on authority ranking.
4. Generate a JSON summary table of the findings.

Focus on accuracy of extraction using OpenAI Assistant API. Handles token limits by iterative processing.
